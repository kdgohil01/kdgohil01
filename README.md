 
👋 Hi, I’m Karmadeepsinh Gohil

💻 I’m a passionate learner and aspiring developer diving deep into Web and Android App Development.

🚀 I’ve built apps like MyNotes Library and a Motivational Quotes App — focusing on UI/UX, Firebase, and real-world functionality.

📱 I love creating smooth, user-friendly apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Firebase.

📂 Check out my work and feel free to collaborate!
